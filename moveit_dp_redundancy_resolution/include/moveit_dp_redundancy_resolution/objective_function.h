 *
 * This file contains a set of classes that are kept together as they
 * they are tightly related from the semantic point of view and must
 * be used together. The ObjectiveFunction class implements a weighted
 * sum of performance indices. Each performance index is implemented
 * by inheriting from the abstract class PerformanceIndex, which
 * requires the method computeLocalCost to be implemented. By default,
 * this library also provides some implementations, but more are
 * possible outside of this class. The ObjectiveFunction class is
 * directly used in the DynamicProgrammingSolver class, as it
 * transparently manages the computation of the objective function,
 * without requiring the DynamicProgrammingSolver to know how to do
 * it. The parameters of the single performance indices (if any), as
 * well as their weight, are loaded from an XML description file. The
 * ObjectiveFunction class is loaded when the
 * MoveGroupDPRedundancyResolutionService is loaded. Thereby it does
 * not require the objective function to be included in the redundancy
 * resolution request.
